## TTG or Talk2God 
I was inspired by my personal journey with respect to understanding spirituality. And I came up with this idea that the almighty G gave us power to choose (or you may call it agency), so I wanted to try to use the skills I have learned (i.e. the mechanism behind The Generaitve Pretrained Transformers) to create something to show gratitude. A chat bot that will be trained on scriptures, testimonies, and other relevant data points to help people 
understand themselves, discover their identities through JC, the almighty heavenly father, and potentially find a solution for their spiritual barricade. 

## Methods
